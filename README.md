# Dependencies:
Ensure that you have all required dependencies to use this resource. I may include support for other dependencies on request. Just send me a message on discord at: springo_1
- ox_lib

# Installation:
Installation is simple! Follow the below steps 
1. Download the resource by navigating to the releases or downloading the code from the button on the top right hand side.
2. Drag the resource into your FiveM resource list.
3. Add the following string to your server.cfg, near the bottom: `ensure springo-fixtextures`
4. Ensure you have all required dependencies downloaded.
That's it, you now have this command working in your server! Do note that it is simple to pack scripts such as these into packs, which is useful for maintaining server resource count. All I ask for is credit!
